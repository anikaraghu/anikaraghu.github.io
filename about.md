Hi, my name is Anika! I'm a proud Oregonian, so by default, I love hiking and
the outdoors, even in the rain. I've spent the past five years
in the Bay Area, studying at Stanford University. I discovered the joy and
power of Computer Science in high school, and I've had an incredible
experience pursuing this field at Stanford. I completed my undergrad degree in
2019, which focused on Artificial Intelligence
and plan to graduate with my Master's degree, which focuses on Computer and Network Security,
in June 2020.

It's important to me to explore my Indian-American identity and find ways to connect back
to my culture. I grew up learning various forms of Indian dance from Bharatnatyam
to Bollywood, and through
[Basmati Raas](https://basmatiraas.wixsite.com/stanford) at Stanford.
Dance continues to be a large part of my life. You can follow my dance journey on
instagram: @dancedanceraghuvanshi.

I care about access to quality education and have worked on various efforts towards
promoting quality education for underserved children in India. I founded and led
the undergrad chapter of [Asha for Education](https://ashanet.org/) at Stanford
and have been honored to work with and support several amazing projects in India that serve
the most vulnerable communities.

I was blessed to be a part of an incredible organization called
[CS+Social Good](https://cs4good.com/) at Stanford. I taught *CS50:Using Tech for Good*, a
class which pairs small groups of students with technical backgrounds
with NGOs/social impact focused
companies, to collaboratively build tech products that align with their mission. Through
this experience, I had the chance to meet an incredible and inspiring group of students
project partners. I believe strongly that with
my privileged education and skillset, I have the
power and responsibility to create positive change in the world. I hope people keep me accountable
to this!

Please don't hesitate to get in contact if you're interested in learning more,
would like to collaborate on anything, or just want to talk :)
